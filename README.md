# randomaliases

I got pretty bored and decided to create some random aliases to make my shell experience funnier. Hopefully there is someone out there that thinks this is good enough to actually use it daily.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wh0crypt/randomaliases.git
```

2. Copy the file containing the aliases to your home directory:

```bash
cp randomaliases/.randomaliases ${HOME}/
```

3. Add the alias file to your shell's configuration file (e.g. `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`):

```bash
echo "[[ -f ~/.randomaliases ]] && . ~/.randomaliases" >> ~/.zshrc
```
